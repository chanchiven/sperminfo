Sperm DNA Fragmentation Test Kit (SCD Assay)
Title: Advanced Genetic Integrity Assessment via Sperm Chromatin Dispersion (SCD) Technology
The Science of Genetic Health:
Traditional semen analysis often fails to detect the "hidden" genetic defects that lead to idiopathic infertility. Sperm DNA fragmentation represents a critical barrier to successful fertilization and healthy embryo development. Even in patients with "normal" routine parameters, high DNA fragmentation is a primary driver of recurrent pregnancy loss and IVF failure.
The Sperminfo® Engineering Advantage:
Our SCD Assay utilizes a proprietary slide-based technology designed to eliminate laboratory variability:
Precision Engineering: Ultra-hydrophobic Teflon-coated slides provide superior sample control, preventing cross-contamination and droplet spreading.
Dimensional Stability: A 20-micron thick proprietary coating ensures optimal reaction volume, providing a stable and reproducible environment for chromatin dispersion.
Secure Capture: Specially treated adhesive wells anchor spermatozoa firmly in place, preventing cell loss during the acid denaturation and lysis phases.
Key Features:
Visual Confidence: Produces a robust and significant "Halo" effect, making result interpretation unambiguous.
Rapid Turnaround: Complete reaction cycle in approximately 25 minutes, significantly faster than TUNEL or SCSA protocols.
Long-term Stability: Formulated for long-term room-temperature storage, reducing cold-chain reliance.
Clinical Reference: Validated against the WHO Laboratory Manual (6th Edition) standards for specialized diagnostic testing.

Sperm DNA Fragmentation Test Kit (Comet Assay)
Title: The Gold Standard in DNA Damage Sensitivity: Single-Cell Gel Electrophoresis (Comet Assay)
The Ultimate Sensitivity:
When clinical scenarios require the highest resolution of DNA damage assessment, the Comet Assay is the definitive choice. Unlike standard screening tests, the Comet Assay utilizes single-cell electrophoresis to migrate fragmented DNA out of the sperm nucleus, creating a "comet-like" tail that can be quantified with high precision.
Why Comet Assay?
Comprehensive Detection: Recognized by the WHO 6th Edition as a specialized test, it is the only assay capable of differentiating between single-strand and double-strand DNA breaks.
Quantitative Precision: Can be analyzed qualitatively via fluorescence microscopy or quantitatively using digital analysis software for an objective Tail Moment calculation.
ICSI & IVF Selection: Critical for evaluating patients with severe male factor infertility or those undergoing high-stakes ART cycles.

Assess Pro-oxidant Activity in Semen (Nitro-blue Tetrazolium / NBT Assay)
Title: Quantifying Oxidative Stress: The NBT Assay for Seminal Pro-oxidant Activity
The Science of ROS:
Oxidative stress is implicated in nearly 80% of male infertility cases. Excessive Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) lead to lipid peroxidation of the sperm membrane and downstream DNA fragmentation. The NBT Assay provides a direct biochemical window into the pro-oxidant status of the ejaculate.
Clinical Application:
Formazan Reaction: Superoxide anions within the semen reduce yellow Nitro-blue Tetrazolium into insoluble blue formazan crystals.
Diagnostic Mapping: Identifies whether oxidative stress is derived from leukocyte infiltration or intrinsic sperm mitochondrial dysfunction.
Therapeutic Monitoring: An essential tool for clinicians to monitor the efficacy of antioxidant therapy in subfertile men.

Anti-sperm Antibodies (ASA) IgA / IgG Test Kits (MAR Assay)
Title: Immunological Infertility Screening: Mixed Antiglobulin Reaction (MAR) Assay
Breaking the Immune Barrier:
In some patients, the body’s immune system treats sperm as foreign invaders. Anti-sperm Antibodies (ASA) coat the sperm surface, hindering progressive motility and blocking the sperm-oocyte interaction. Our MAR Assay (available for IgA and IgG) is the "Gold Standard" for diagnosing immunological infertility
Key Advantages:
Class-Specific Detection: Separate IgA and IgG kits allow for a detailed immunological profile. IgG is the primary screen, while IgA offers high clinical correlation with reduced fertilization rates.
Direct & Efficient: Optimized for testing directly on raw semen, eliminating the need for sperm washing which can lead to false-negative results.
User-Centric Design: Engineered for fast results and a simplified workflow that easily integrates into routine laboratory settings.

Prestained Sperm Morphology Staining Slides (Improved Diff-Quik II Formula)
Title: Standardized Morphological Precision: Improved Diff-Quik II Prestained Slides
Clinical Accuracy, Simplified:
Morphology is the most difficult parameter to standardize in andrology. Our Prestained Slides utilize an Improved Diff-Quik II formula to provide high-contrast visualization of the acrosome, nucleus, midpiece, and tail, strictly adhering to Kruger’s Strict Criteria.
Workflow Optimization:
Zero Preparation: Ready-to-use slides eliminate the mess and variability of traditional multi-step staining jars.
Rapid Staining: Achieve diagnostic-grade results in seconds.
Integrity Preservation: The proprietary formulation ensures no distortion of the sperm’s original shape, allowing for accurate measurement of the acrosomal index and tail defects.

Semen Liquefaction Kit (Enzyme Digestion Assay)
Title: Resolving Semen Hyperviscosity: Advanced Enzyme Digestion Technology
Preserving the Sample:
Delayed liquefaction (over 60 minutes) and high viscosity trap sperm in a gel-like matrix, artificially lowering motility scores and interfering with IUI/IVF processing. While mechanical methods (syringing) can damage DNA, our Enzyme Digestion Assay provides a gentle, biochemical solution.
The Sperminfo® Advantage:
Gentle Proteolysis: Utilizes a purified enzymatic formula to normalize viscosity without impacting sperm membrane integrity.
Improved Accuracy: Essential for obtaining representative aliquots for concentration, motility, and DFI testing.
Reference: A critical lab tool for managing samples with high viscosity as highlighted in the WHO guidelines for semen processing.

Sperm Vitality Staining Solution (Eosin-Nigrosin Staining)
Title: Rapid Membrane Integrity Assessment: One-Step Eosin-Nigrosin Vitality Stain
Differentiating Live from Dead:
In samples with low motility (<40%), it is vital to determine if immobile sperm are live but dyskinetic, or actually dead (Necrozoospermia). Our Sperm Vitality Staining Solution uses the Eosin-Nigrosin method to provide immediate clarity.
Performance Features:
High-Contrast Visualization: Nigrosin creates a dark, uniform background, making live (unstained) sperm stand out with brilliant clarity.
One-Step Efficiency: Our optimized formula combines staining and background contrast into a single step, significantly faster than traditional two-step protocols.
ICSI Selection: Provides essential data for selecting viable sperm in zero-motility cases.

Semen Leukocyte Staining Solution (Peroxidase Assay)
Title: Diagnosing Subclinical Inflammation: Semen Leukocyte Peroxidase Assay
Beyond Round Cells:
Standard microscopy often confuses immature germ cells with white blood cells (WBCs). Our Peroxidase Assay provides a definitive differentiation, staining leukocytes brown while leaving germ cells unstained.
Clinical Significance:
Inflammation Detection: Identifies Leukocytospermia (>1 million/mL), a key indicator of accessory gland infection or prostatitis.
ROS Prevention: High leukocyte counts are a primary source of ROS; early detection allows for targeted antibiotic or anti-inflammatory treatment to protect sperm health.

Sperm Counting Chamber (Disposable)
